Hey Team,

Welcome to the digital headquarters for **Learnwu (Learn With You)**. Everything we build here is a step towards making language a bridge, not a barrier.

## üéØ Our Purpose

Our vision is to create the world's most personal and effective platform for mastering a new language.

We achieve this by connecting passionate learners with exceptional tutors through smart, human-centric technology. We empower tutors with great teaching tools and delight learners with a seamless, encouraging experience.

## ‚ú® Our Principles

* **Tutor-Empowered:** We build with them, for them.
* **Simplicity is Key:** We fight complexity to create a joy to use.
* **One Team, One Dream:** We trust each other and communicate openly.
