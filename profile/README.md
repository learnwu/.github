## Our Values

These principles guide our decisions, our collaborations, and the product we build for our users.

* **Be Student-Obsessed:** Our usersâ€”both students and tutorsâ€”are at the absolute center of our universe. We listen with empathy and build with purpose to solve their real-world problems.
* **Empower Through Connection:** We are building more than a marketplace; we are building a community. Every feature should foster trust, encourage communication, and strengthen the human connection that makes learning so powerful.
* **Pursue Simplicity:** Education can be complex, but our platform shouldn't be. We relentlessly pursue clarity and simplicity in our design and engineering to create an experience that is intuitive, accessible, and joyful to use.
* **Succeed as One Team:** We are open, honest, and supportive. We share our challenges, celebrate our victories, and move forward together. Great ideas can come from anywhere, and we trust each other to do our best work.
